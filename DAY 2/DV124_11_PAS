A4. PERIODS
OCTET

Q5. IP address 4 is made up of ______________sets of eight binary bits
A5. 4 SETS

Q6. In IPv4 starting from the left, the first bit has a value of 128 then 64 then 32 and so on to 1. Each bit on the octet can be either a 1 or a 0. If the number is a 1 then the number that it represents__________. If the number is a_______ then the number that it represents does not count.
A6. COUNTS
0

A16. SUBNET MASK

Q17. Subnet mask is a number that resembles an IP address it reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for the network by mask in the ______________ portion of the IP address.
A17. NETWORK PORTION

Q18. _________it will indicate the position of the IP address that defines the network.
A18. WHEN THE SUBNET MASK BINARY DIGIT IS 1

Q19. We cross up all the digit in the IP address that line up with the 1 in the subnet mask and when you this it will reveal that the first two octets are the network portion and the remaining is the host portion. (True/False)
A19. TRUE

Q20. A class A IP address range is_____________ to ___________. This class supports ___________host on 126 networks. This class is mainly given to large organizations because of the tremendous amount of the IP addresses is given out.
A20. 1 - 126
16 MILLION

A23. INTERNAL LOOPBACK TESTING FUNCTIONS

Q24. Public IP addresses are publicly registered on the internet. Which basically means that if you have a public IP address you have access to the internet. But private IP address are different. (True/False)
A24. TRUE

Q25. Why you cannot directly access the internet with a private IP?
A25. NOT PUBLICLY REGISTERED.
1 PUBLICLY REGISTERED IP ADDRESS BEING USED TO ACCESS INTERNET, 10 PRIVATE IPS TRANSLATED INTO 1 PUBLIC IP.

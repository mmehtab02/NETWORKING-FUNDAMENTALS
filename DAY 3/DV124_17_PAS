Q1. A loopback interface is a virtual interface created on a_____________
A1. ROUTER

Q2. In terminal when we are in configuration mode we need to enter __________key for interface
A2.  INT
CONF T (CONFIGURATION MODE)
INT LOOPBACK0
IP ADDRESS 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

Q3. A routing table is a file that contains a set of __________that shows information on what path a data packet takes to its destination
A3. RULES

Q4. What does a basic routing table contain?
A4. A NETWORK DESTINATION (IP ADDRESS OF FINAL DESTINATION)
A SUBNET MASK (DETERMINES HOST AND NETWORK PORTION OF IP ADDRESS)
A GATEWAY (WHICH IP ADDRESS THE DATA PACKET SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO)
THE INTERFACE (OUTGOING IP ADDRESS OF DEVICE SENDING THE DATA)
NEXT HOP (IP ADDRESS TO WHICH THE IP ADDRESS IS FORWARDED TO)
METRIC (DETERMINES BEST ROUTE AMONG MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS)

Q5. In order data to travel across a network and reach its destination, it needs a map to determine the best path to take and a way it does this is using a ______protocols
A5. ROUTING

Q6. Routing protocols collect information about the current network status and map out the best path for ______________to take to their specific destination.
A6. DATA PACKETS

Q7. What are the types of routing protocols?
A7. DISTANCE VECTOR
LINK STATE
HYBRID

Q8. Distance vector protocols are factors in distance to the destination based on how many hops. (True/False)
A8. TRUE

Q9. RIP stands for______________
A9. ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL

Q10. RIP is the oldest routing protocol. Routers that uses RIP, broadcasts their routing information to other routers in every 30 seconds regardless if routing information has changed or not. (True/False)
A10. TRUE

Q11. Why did the developers create RIPv2?
A11. IT SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF EXCESSIVE BROADCAST TRAFFIC THAT RIPV1 CAUSED.

Q12. BGP stands for__________________
A12  BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCOL

Q12.1. BGP determines ___________that are based on paths and policies
A12.1. ROUTING DIRECTIONS

Q13. Link state is a routing protocol that is used by_____________ to share information and independently map out the best path on a network.
A13. ROUTERS

Q14. Give example of link state protocol
A14. OSPF
IS-IS

Q15. OSPF stands for _____________________
A15. OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST

Q16. IS-IS which stands for___________________
A16. INTERMEDIATE SYSTEM TO INTERMEDIATE SYSTEM


Q17. IS-IS primarily functions within domains and it uses Connectionless Network Service (CLNS).  (True/False)
A17. TRUE

Q18. EIGRP stands for___________________
A18. ENHANCED INTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING PROTOCOL
(COMBINATION OF DISTANCE VECTOR AND LINK STATE PROTOCOLS) (RUNS ON CISCO ROUTERS)

Q19. SIP stands for ________________
A19. SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL

Q20. VOIP is _____________IP
A20. A TERM USED FOR VOICE COMMUNICATION OVER IP NETWORKS
(VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL)
(APPLICATION LAYER OF OSI MODEL)

Q21. RTP stands for __________________
A21. REAL-TIME TRANSPORT PROTOCOL

Q22. RTP is often used over UDP so it doesnâ€™t guarantee data delivery. True/False)
A22. TRUE

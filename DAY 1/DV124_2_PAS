A17. TYPE A
TYPE B

Q18. Firewire is recognized by D- shape. This type of connection is becoming more popular on desktops and laptops and is commonly associated with attaching peripheral devices, such as digital cameras and printers, rather than network connections.
A18.  IEEE 1394
TRUE
THESE ARE ALSO FOUND IN MANY TYPES OF VIDEO AND MULTIMEDIA DEVICES.

Q19. MT-RJ stands for______________. This is a fibre optic cable connector. It used the latched ___________ connections. And it has a small form factor for high packed density.
A19. MECHANICAL TRANSFER-REGISTERED JACK
PUSH-PULL

Q20. ST stands for ________ is a half twist pair net type of lock. And is commonly used with single mode fibre optic cable.

Q23. The term serial refers to sending data one bit at a time. Serial cables are cables that carry serial data transmission and a most common form of serial cables used the RS-232 standards which uses the common D shaped connectors such as a DB-9 and DB-25. (True/False)
A23. TRUE

Q24. The point that a connectors join, light is transmitted from one connector to the other connector but at that point light passes through the other connector it will reflect back in the opposite direction towards the light source and as this happens there is signal loss. This is what happens in UPC connectors. Light is reflected directly back. (True/False)
A24. TRUE

Q25. As a technology progressed new connectors were developed to decrease the signal loss and that is called the ____________
A25. APC CONNECTOR

Q26. What is the difference between the UPC and APC?
A26. THE ANGLE OF THE TIP WHERE THE CONNECTION IS MADE.

Q27. With the___________, the light reflects back towards the light source. But with the _________ with its angle connections the light doesn’t reflect back towards the light source it reflects back to the angle to the wall of a cable as a result it greatly reduces the signal loss.
A27. UPC
APC

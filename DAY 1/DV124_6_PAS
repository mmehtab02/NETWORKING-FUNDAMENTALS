A4. 1000 BASE-T

Q5. Category 6 also has a maximum speed of 1000 Mbps and it is also used on 1000Base-t ethernet network but it's more of a ______________duty cable compared to category 5e.
A5. HEAVIER


Q6. Category 6 is used in 10G Base-T networks which has a maximum speed of 10,000 Mbps but only for cable links of less than 100 meters. (True/False)
A6. TRUE

Q7. category 6a or augmented and this has a maximum speed of 10,000 Mbps and is used on __________ networks and unlike category 6 this has a maximum length 100 meters.
A7. 10G BASE-T

Q8. Unshielded twisted cable by default is the most common type of cable used today. It consists of four _____________ wires twisted around each other.
A8. UNSHIELDED

Q9. UDP wires are twisted to prevent ______________interference or cross talk. And is mainly used to_______________.

A9. ELECTROMAGNETIC
LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)

Q10. STP stands for _____________ cable is similar to unshielded twisted pair except that it has four shields that cover the wires.
A10. SHIELDED TWISTED PAIR


Q11. Shielding adds a layer of protection against electromagnetic interference linking into or out of the cable in STP. (True/False)
A11. TRUE

Q12. ________________ is used today primarily by cable providers to provide a computer with broad band internet connection. Early on it was used as the backbone for networks such as a ________ network.
A12. COAXIAL CABLE
BUS

Q13. RJ-6 is made for long distances and commonly used for cable television and___________________.
A13. INTERNET CONNECTION

Q14. RJ-59 is made for short distances and commonly used for high definition and high-quality video. (True/False)
A14. TRUE

Q15. SMF stands for ___________________
A15. SINGLE MODE FIBER

Q16. How does fibre optic cable send data?
A16. USES PULSES OF LIGHT - VERY FAST AND LONG DISTANCE

Q17. What are the two different types of optic fibre?
A17.  SINGLE MODE FIBER
MULTIMODE FIBER

Q18. Single mode fibre is a fibre optic cable that allows a light to enter only at a single angle as you see in the picture. So, in this type of transmission of light entering at this angle it can travel great distances. (True/False)
A18. TRUE

Q19. MMF stands for _______________, a difference between multimode and single mode is that in multimode light travels in _________ beams that reflect of the walls of the cables
 A19. MULTIMODE FIBER
MULTIPLE

Q20. Unlike single mode fibre, multimode fibre is made for ______________ distances.
A20. SHORT

Q21. If you want a different type of media such as _________, _____________or coaxial within your network. Whether you can convert the internet to all these types by using a media converter.
A21. FIBER, ETHERNET

Q22. Multimedia allows you to convert the different types of media such as converting single and multimode fibre to ethernet, fibre to coaxial and single mode fibre to multimode fibre and so on.  (True/False)
A22. TRUE

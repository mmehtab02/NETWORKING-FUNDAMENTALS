Q1
What do you mean by “TOPOLOGY”?
A
THE LAYOUT OF HOW A NETWORK COMMUNICATES WITH DIFFERENT DEVICES.
Q2
Name the most common Topology?
A
STAR TOPOLOGY.
Q3
In ___________ topology the computers are connected to the central wiring point such as a Hub or a Switch.
A
STAR.
Q4
data on Star Network  passes through the _________ point before continuing to its destination.


A
CENTRAL.
Q5
The major benefits of Star  topology is that if  one computer failed or if there was a break in a cable the other computers will  not be affected. Why?


A
EACH COMPUTER HAS THEIR OWN CABLE CONNECTION.
Q6
Major disadvantage of a star topology is that if the central hub or switch fails, the other computers on that central point would be affected and this is called a ?
A
SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE.
Q7
What happens if we have Single Point of Failure?
A
THE ENTIRE NETWORK GOES DOWN.
Q8
Name the network topology where  computer devices and network devices are connected to a single cable?
A
BUS TOPOLOGY.
Q9
Backbone of Bus Topology is known as?
A
COAXIAL CABLE. (BUS/TRUNK)
Q10
In Bus Topology, the  computers are connected with this cable using special connectors called BNC which are also known as ?


 A
T-CONNECTORS.
Q11
One of the advantages of the bus topology is ?
A
IT IS VERY CHEAP AND EASY TO IMPLEMENT.
Q12
However the disadvantage of the bus topology is that it requires that the cable be terminated at both ends using ?
A
TERMINATORS.
Q13
If a computer is removed or added or if terminators are loose or missing then the cable would be open and data will bounce back and this is known as ?
A
SIGNAL-REFLECTION.
Q14
What happens if we have signal-reflection?
A
DATA FLOW WOULD BE DISRUPTED.
Q15
Name the type of network configuration where each computer is connected to each other and shaped of a closed loop or ring so every computer on this ring has exactly two neighbors
A
RING TOPOLOGY.
Q16
The advantage of ring topology is that it is easy to ?
A
IS IT EASY TO INSTALL AND TROUBLESHOOT.
Q17
The dis-advantage of ring topology ?
A
IF ONE OF THE COMPUTERS GOES DOWN OR IF THERE WAS A SINGLE BREAK IN THE CABLE THEN ALL DATA FLOW WOULD BE DISRUPTED.
Q18
Name a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another?
A
MESH TOPOLOGY
Q19
In Mesh Topology each computer on the network connects to every other computer on the network so by having so many connections it handles_____ very well.


A
FAILURE
Q20
Mesh Topology  setup allows for most transmissions to be distributed even if ___ of the connections goes down.



A
ONE
Q21
Mesh Topology  is  commonly used for?
A
WIRELESS
Q22
Mesh Topology can be expensive due to ?
A
THE AMOUNT OF CABLING AND NETWORK CARDS THAT HAVE TO BE USED.
(4 COMPUTERS, 3 CONNECTIONS EACH, 12 TOTAL)
Q23
Due to expensive Mesh Topology is rarely used in _________ Area Network.
A
LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LAN)
Q24
Mesh Topology is mainly used in _______ Area Network.
A
WIDE AREA NETWORKS (WAN)
Q25
Name a perfect example of Mesh Topology?
A
INTERNET
Q26
The advantage of Mesh Topology is it creates a ?
A
HIGH REDUNDANCY LEVEL v
Q27
Will computers still be able to communicate In Mesh Topology what happens if One or more connections fail? (YES /NO)
A
YES
Q28
Topologies can also be combined with other topologies if needed and these were known as ?


A
HYBRID TOPOLOGY
Q29
Name the  most common form of hybrid topologies


A
STAR RING, STAR BUS
Q30
In a Star Bus network ________ star topologies linked together using a single cable bus connection.
A
TWO OR MORE
Q31
In a Star Ring network_________ring networks are linked together to form a large link network.
A
TWO OR MORE
Q32
In Point to Point Topology are two hosts that are directly connected to each other using______.
A
A SINGLE CABLE
Q33
 These hosts could be____?
A
COMPUTERS, SWITCHES, ROUTERS, SERVERS, ETC.
Q34
In A Client Server Topology  clients connect directly to a ____________to access resources rather than connecting to each other.


A
CENTRALIZED DEDICATED SERVER
Q35
Why do a lot of businesses use this Client Server  topology?
A
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PUT ALL THE RESOURCES ON EACH COMPUTER WHICH IS A LOT MORE WORK.
THE ADMINISTRATOR CAN PUT ALL THE DATA ON ONE MACHINE THEN ALL THE CLIENTS CAN ACCESS THE RESOURCES WHEN NEEDED.
OBVIOUSLY PUTTING RESOURCES ON JUST ONE MACHINE IS LESS WORK, THEN PUTTING THE DATA ON MULTIPLE CLIENTS MAKES THE ADMINISTRATION SIMPLER.
Q36
Point to Multipoint Topology is a network architecture that is commonly used in _________outdoor network.


A
WIRELESS
Q37
In _________ you would have a central wireless base station and there would be other wireless locations around it that connect to the single central location.
A
POINT TO MULTIPOINT TOPOLOGY
Q38
In Point to Multipoint Topology , these other locations would directly communicate to the other locations. (YES/NO)
A
NO
Q39
In Point to Multipoint Topology , the wireless locations were called clients and a central location is commonly called an access point or a________?


A
BASE STATION
Q40
_________Topology is where all the clients on the network talk to every other client on the network to share their resources with each other.
A
PEER TO PEER
Q41
In Peer to Peer Topology ,one computer can share their printer, another computer can share their file on their hard drive and so on.(True/False)?


A
TRUE
Q42
In Peer to Peer Topology , there is no centralized server that the clients connect to.(True / False)?
A
TRUE
Q43
Peer to Peer  topology is simple to set up. You will typically find them in homes and small businesses.(True /False)?
TRUE

A2. 	TRUE

Q3. A firewall controls the flow of traffic coming into and out of the network through its___________ that stands for _________. It is a list of roles on what can access the network. It either allows or denies permissions.

Q13. A ______________firewall monitors all the connections and data streams that are passing through and a record of it.
A13. STATEFUL

A14. APPLICATION
PREVIOUS SESSION
FACTORS

Q15. A ___________firewall on the other hand does not do a thorough job as a stateful firewall does.

Q16. A stateless firewall uses an ACL to allow or deny traffic. It does not thoroughly inspect the data packet. It only looks in to the header portion of the data packets. And it does not keep record of previous data packets.  (True/False)
A16. TRUE

A20. COMMON BEHAVIOR
BLOCK

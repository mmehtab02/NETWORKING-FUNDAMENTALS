Q1. DOCSIS Modem stands for ___________________. And those who have broadband cable internet will recognize this device.
A1. DATA OVER CABLE SERVICE INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS

Q2. DOCSIS modem handles both incoming and outgoing data signals including internet video and voice. The DOCSIS 3.1 specifications support speeds of 10 GB downstream and 1 GB upstream. (True/False)
A2. TRUE

Q3. A hub is a device that has multiple ports that accepts ______________ from network devices. It is considered not to be intelligent because it does not filter any data or has any intelligence to where data is supposed to be sent.
A3. ETHERNET CONNECTIONS

Q4. A data packet arrives at one of the ports it is copied to all other ports. All the devices on that hub sees that data packet. (True/False)
A4. TRUE

Q5. The two types of hubs are _____________ and _______________.
A5. PASSIVE
ACTIVE

Q6. What is the difference between Passive and active hubs?
A6. PASSIVE - DOES NOT REQUIRE POWER
ACTIVE - REQUIRES POWER

Q7. A switch is very similar to a hub. It is also a device that has multiple ports that accepts _____________through network devices.
A7. ETHERNET CONNECTIONS

Q8. A switch can actually learn the __________ addresses of the devices that are connected to it and it stores these addresses to cables.
A8. PHYSICAL

Q9. When a data packet is sent to a switch, it directs it only to the intended destination port. (True/False)
A9. TRUE

Q10. Multilayer switch is operated at higher levels of the __________ model. A multilayer switch can operate at ________ and ________ 3 of the OSI model. It is able to interpret layer 3 data similar to a router.
A10. OSI
LAYER 2 AND LAYER 3

Q11. A _____________ switch operates at layers 4 to 7 of the OSI MODEL. This type of switch can perform load balancing and advanced filtering. And these switches are also very expensive.
A11. CONTENT

Q12. POE which stands for _________________, gets data from the same cable which is through the ethernet cables. As don’t have any electrical port
A12.  POWER OVER ETHERNET

Q13. In some networks _____________ _ are installed in case a switch does fail so in a case of failure the data can bypass a failed switch and use the other to get the destination.
A13. MULTIPLE SWITCHES

Q14. A potential problem can happen with multiple switch network is that with broad_____________. These loops can happen when there are multiple active paths between the destination. And when this happens it can ________ the network because of the excess traffic.
A14. TRAFFIC LOOPS
SLOW DOWN

Q15. To solve the cast traffic loops problem the __________ protocol is created. It allows for fault tolerance and prevents unnecessary ___________in the networks. And it does this by allowing the switches to talk to each other to find if loops are happening in the network.
A15. SPANNING TREE
TRAFFIC LOOPS
Q16. ____________ are used to divide a network to separate collision domains.
A16. BRIDGES
Q17. If you add a bridge to a network it will reduce any unnecessary traffic between two segments by filtering the data based on their MAC address. Bridge only allows data to crossover to a MAC address of the destination because a bridge keeps record of all the Mac addresses. (True/False)
A17. TRUE
Q18. A router is a device that routes data from one network to another based on its________. When a data packet is received from the router, the router inspects the packet and determines if the packet was meant for______________.
 A18. IP ADDRESS
ITS OWN NETWORK OR IF IT’S MEANT FOR ANOTHER NETWORK


Q19. If the router determines that the data packet is meant for its own network it receives it. But if it is not meant for its own network, it sends it off to another network. A router is essentially a gateway for a network. (True/False)
A19. TRUE
Q20. A ________ can be defined as a device that joins 2 networks together. They interconnect networks with different or incompatible communication ___________. It however does not change the data, it only changes the format of the data.
 A20. GATEWAY
PROTOCOLS
Q21. CSU and DSU stands for ________________ and ________________
A21. CHANNEL SERVICE UNIT
DATA SERVICE UNIT
Q22. CSU/DSU converts data from______________ to ________, because their data formats are very different.
A22. LAN
WAN

Q23. NICS stands for ____________ is used to connect the computer to a network. It is basically a circuit board or network adapter that is installed on your computer. And its jobs is to convert ____________ into ____________
A23. NETWORK INTERFACE CARD
INCOMING SERIAL DATA
PARALLEL DATA
Q24. A ___________ is a device that has both a transmitter and a receiver in the same package. The term applies to wireless communication in devices.
A24. TRANSCEIVER
(CELLPHONES, 2 WAY RADIOS)
Q25. ____________ is basically a wireless hub that is used for wireless devices. It connects to a wired network and releases data between _______network and the wireless device for communication purposes.
A25. WIRELESS ACCESS POINT (WAP)
WIRED
Q26. A dialogue modem is a device that allows a computer to transmit data over normal telephone lines. The data coming in from a telephone line is __________. A data in a computer is all ___________
A26. ANALOG
DIGITAL

A27. 56 KBPS
